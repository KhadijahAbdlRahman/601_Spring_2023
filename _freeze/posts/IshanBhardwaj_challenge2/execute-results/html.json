More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(birds, 100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 100 × 14\n   `Domain Code` Domain     `Area Code` Area  `Element Code` Element `Item Code`\n   <chr>         <chr>            <dbl> <chr>          <dbl> <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 2 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 3 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 4 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 5 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 6 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 7 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 8 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n 9 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n10 QA            Live Anim…           2 Afgh…           5112 Stocks         1057\n# ℹ 90 more rows\n# ℹ 7 more variables: Item <chr>, `Year Code` <dbl>, Year <dbl>, Unit <chr>,\n#   Value <dbl>, Flag <chr>, `Flag Description` <chr>\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbird_type_table <- table(select(birds, \"Item\"))\nbird_type_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nItem\n              Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls \n                 13074                   6909                   4136 \n  Pigeons, other birds                Turkeys \n                  1165                   5693 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstock_source_table <- table(select(birds, \"Flag Description\"))\nstock_source_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFlag Description\nAggregate, may include official, semi-official, estimated or calculated data \n                                                                        6488 \n                                                          Data not available \n                                                                        1002 \n                                    FAO data based on imputation methodology \n                                                                        1213 \n                                                                FAO estimate \n                                                                       10007 \n                                                               Official data \n                                                                       10773 \n                                                           Unofficial figure \n                                                                        1494 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis dataset presents the \"stocks\" or count of live animals present in different areas from the year 1961 to 2018. The live animals analysed are turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese + guinea fowls, pigeons, and \"other birds\". The unit in which the stocks are counted is 1000 head. This data was likely gathered by the FAO, or the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This is because for the \"Flag Description\" variable, which describes the source of each observation in the dataset, the only *organization* listed as a source is the FAO.\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary <- birds %>%\n  select(\"Area\", \"Year\", \"Item\", \"Value\", \"Unit\") %>%\n  group_by(Item) %>%\n  # Mean, median, and standard deviation of stocks of different animals\n  summarise(mean_stocks = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE),\n            median_stocks = median(Value, na.rm=TRUE),\n            std_stocks = sd(Value, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_stocks))\nsummary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  Item                   mean_stocks median_stocks std_stocks\n  <chr>                        <dbl>         <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 Chickens                   207931.        10784.   1081629.\n2 Ducks                       23072.          510     110621.\n3 Turkeys                     15228.          528      56416.\n4 Geese and guinea fowls      10292.          258      44489.\n5 Pigeons, other birds         6163.         2800       8481.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis tabulates general summary statistics for the birds dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhighest <- birds %>%\n  select(\"Area\", \"Year\", \"Item\", \"Value\", \"Unit\") %>%\n  filter(`Area` == \"World\", `Item` == \"Chickens\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(Value))\nhighest\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 58 × 5\n   Area   Year Item        Value Unit     \n   <chr> <dbl> <chr>       <dbl> <chr>    \n 1 World  2018 Chickens 23707134 1000 Head\n 2 World  2017 Chickens 23212565 1000 Head\n 3 World  2016 Chickens 22826754 1000 Head\n 4 World  2015 Chickens 21678753 1000 Head\n 5 World  2014 Chickens 21118803 1000 Head\n 6 World  2013 Chickens 20953583 1000 Head\n 7 World  2012 Chickens 20489756 1000 Head\n 8 World  2010 Chickens 20244638 1000 Head\n 9 World  2011 Chickens 19950281 1000 Head\n10 World  2009 Chickens 19720796 1000 Head\n# ℹ 48 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom here, we see that the highest world count of chickens was in 2018. Furthermore, we see a relatively consistent decrease in the chicken stock as we go to each previous year, especially in the years of the 21st century. This could hint at an increasing yearly population, which increases the demand for chickens.\n\n### Explain and Interpret\n\nBe sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n\nThe summary code chunk above groups the birds dataset by the five different bird categories. It then calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of the stocks of these groups. After arranging them we see that in general, the number of chickens far outweighs the counts of other birds. However, this result comes with a lot of variance, which means that for the areas whose stocks are composed of chickens, some have either a very high or a very low stock. Ducks, turkeys, and geese + guinea fowls have stocks relatively within the same range, and pigeons have the lowest mean stock. This grouping arrangement is insightful because it gives us information on which types of birds may be cheaper to rear.",
