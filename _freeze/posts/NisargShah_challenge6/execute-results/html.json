Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\\\n\nthe data is ready for analysis without further cleaning or reshaping.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf$date <- as.Date(paste0(\"01-\",gsub(\":Q\", \"-01-\", df$\"Year and Quarter\")), format = \"%d-%y-%m\")\n\ndf[, 2:8] <- sapply(df[, 2:8], as.numeric)\n\ndf$Mortgage_pct <- df$Mortgage / df$Total * 100\ndf$HE_Revolving_pct <- df$\"HE Revolving\" / df$Total * 100\ndf$Auto_Loan_pct <- df$\"Auto Loan\" / df$Total * 100\ndf$Credit_Card_pct <- df$\"Credit Card\" / df$Total * 100\ndf$Student_Loan_pct <- df$\"Student Loan\" / df$Total * 100\ndf$Other_pct <- df$Other / df$Total * 100\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Time Dependent Visualization\n\nI chose a line chart because it is ideal for showing the trend or evolution of a variable over time. The x-axis shows the year, and the y-axis shows the total debt amount. Each point on the line represents the total debt amount for a specific quarter. By connecting the points with a line, we can see how the total debt amount has changed over time. The line chart is also useful for identifying any seasonal patterns or trends in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(df, aes(date, Total)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Debt\", title = \"Evolution of Total Debt\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NisargShah_challenge6_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualizing Part-Whole Relationships\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(debt_data, aes(x = Date, y = Total, fill = factor(substitute))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Consumer Debt ($ trillions)\",\n       title = \"Composition of Total Consumer Debt by Loan Type\",\n       fill = \"Loan Type\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(debt_data, aes(x = Date, y = Total, fill = factor(substitute))): object 'debt_data' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
