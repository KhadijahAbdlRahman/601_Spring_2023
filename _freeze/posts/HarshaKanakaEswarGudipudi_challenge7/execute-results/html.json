And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - eggs ⭐\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  - australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n  - hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n  - us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n  - faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in the data\ndf <- read.csv(\"_data/abc_poll_2021.csv\")\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       id xspanish complete_status ppage\n1 7230001  English       qualified    68\n2 7230002  English       qualified    85\n3 7230003  English       qualified    69\n4 7230004  English       qualified    74\n5 7230005  English       qualified    77\n6 7230006  English       qualified    70\n                                                           ppeduc5\n1 High school graduate (high school diploma or the equivalent GED)\n2                                             Bachelor\\x92s degree\n3 High school graduate (high school diploma or the equivalent GED)\n4                                             Bachelor\\x92s degree\n5 High school graduate (high school diploma or the equivalent GED)\n6                                             Bachelor\\x92s degree\n                    ppeducat ppgender              ppethm pphhsize\n1                High school   Female White, Non-Hispanic        2\n2 Bachelors degree or higher     Male White, Non-Hispanic        2\n3                High school     Male White, Non-Hispanic        2\n4 Bachelors degree or higher   Female White, Non-Hispanic        1\n5                High school     Male White, Non-Hispanic        3\n6 Bachelors degree or higher     Male White, Non-Hispanic        2\n                ppinc7    ppmarit5   ppmsacat    ppreg4\n1   $25,000 to $49,999 Now Married Metro area     South\n2     $150,000 or more Now Married Metro area     South\n3 $100,000 to $149,999 Now Married Metro area     South\n4   $25,000 to $49,999    Divorced Metro area NorthEast\n5   $10,000 to $24,999 Now Married Metro area   MidWest\n6   $75,000 to $99,999 Now Married Metro area   MidWest\n                                                     pprent     ppstaten\n1 Owned or being bought by you or someone in your household      Florida\n2 Owned or being bought by you or someone in your household     Kentucky\n3 Owned or being bought by you or someone in your household      Florida\n4 Owned or being bought by you or someone in your household Pennsylvania\n5 Owned or being bought by you or someone in your household     Michigan\n6 Owned or being bought by you or someone in your household     Missouri\n                               PPWORKA          ppemploy       Q1_a       Q1_b\n1                              Retired       Not working    Approve    Approve\n2                              Retired       Not working    Approve    Approve\n3                              Retired       Not working Disapprove Disapprove\n4                              Retired       Not working    Approve    Approve\n5                              Retired       Not working    Approve    Approve\n6 Employed part-time (by someone else) Working part-time    Approve    Approve\n        Q1_c       Q1_d       Q1_e       Q1_f                 Q2  Q3        Q4\n1 Disapprove    Approve    Approve Disapprove   Not so concerned Yes      Good\n2    Approve    Approve    Approve    Approve Somewhat concerned Yes      Good\n3 Disapprove Disapprove Disapprove    Approve     Very concerned Yes      Poor\n4    Approve    Approve    Approve    Approve Somewhat concerned Yes Excellent\n5    Approve    Approve    Approve    Approve Somewhat concerned Yes Excellent\n6    Approve    Approve Disapprove    Approve   Not so concerned Yes Excellent\n           Q5           QPID ABCAGE                                Contact\n1  Optimistic     A Democrat    65+ No, I am not willing to be interviewed\n2  Optimistic An Independent    65+ No, I am not willing to be interviewed\n3 Pessimistic Something else    65+ No, I am not willing to be interviewed\n4 Pessimistic An Independent    65+    Yes, I am willing to be interviewed\n5  Optimistic     A Democrat    65+ No, I am not willing to be interviewed\n6  Optimistic     A Democrat    65+ No, I am not willing to be interviewed\n  weights_pid\n1      0.6382\n2      0.5493\n3      0.8488\n4      0.8126\n5      0.4994\n6      0.4043\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\nThe dataset consists of 527 observations, each representing an individual. The variables in the dataset include demographic information such as age, gender, ethnicity, education level, household size, income range, marital status, and region of residence. The dataset also includes variables related to work status, employment, and political affiliation. Additionally, there are multiple-choice questions and responses, along with measures of concern, self-perceived quality of life, and optimism/pessimism about the future. The dataset also contains information about the individual's willingness to be interviewed and weights assigned to each observation. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various demographic and socio-political factors for a sample of individuals. It offers valuable insights into the characteristics and perspectives of the respondents, making it suitable for analyzing relationships and patterns among the variables and drawing conclusions about the population they represent.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 527  31\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(df)\n```\n\n:::

For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nCreating a new column called \"ppage_category\" the cut() function. This new column categorizes the values in the \"ppage\" column into different age groups based on specified intervals. The resulting \"ppage_category\" column provides a categorical representation of the age groups: \"Young\", \"Middle-aged\", \"Senior\", and \"Unknown\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselected_data <- df[, c(\"id\", \"ppage\", \"ppeducat\", \"ppgender\", \"ppethm\", \"pphhsize\", \"ppinc7\")]\n\nselected_data$ppage_category <- cut(selected_data$ppage,\n                                    breaks = c(0, 30, 50, 70, Inf),\n                                    labels = c(\"Young\", \"Middle-aged\", \"Senior\", \"Unknown\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\ncreating two visualizations. The first is a bar chart showing the count of responses for each question. The second is a stacked bar chart displaying the count of responses for each question, grouped by gender and ethnicity.These visualizations allow us to explore the distribution of responses across different questions and examine how it varies by gender and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a bar chart of count by Question and Response\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = Question, fill = Response)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Count by Question and Response\",\n       x = \"Question\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       fill = \"Response\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HarshaKanakaEswarGudipudi_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a stacked bar chart of count by Question response Approve, grouped by Gender and Ethnicity\nggplot(tidy_data %>%filter(Response == \"Approve\"), aes(x = Question, fill = ppethm)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ppgender) +\n  labs(title = \"Count by Question, Gender, and Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Question\",\n       y = \"Proportion\",\n       fill = \"Ethnicity\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HarshaKanakaEswarGudipudi_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
