And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - eggs ⭐\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  - australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n  - hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n  - us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n  - faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nab_nyc <- read_csv(\"_data/AB_NYC_2019.csv\")\nab_nyc\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 48,895 × 16\n      id name       host_id host_name neighbourhood_group neighbourhood latitude\n   <dbl> <chr>        <dbl> <chr>     <chr>               <chr>            <dbl>\n 1  2539 Clean & q…    2787 John      Brooklyn            Kensington        40.6\n 2  2595 Skylit Mi…    2845 Jennifer  Manhattan           Midtown           40.8\n 3  3647 THE VILLA…    4632 Elisabeth Manhattan           Harlem            40.8\n 4  3831 Cozy Enti…    4869 LisaRoxa… Brooklyn            Clinton Hill      40.7\n 5  5022 Entire Ap…    7192 Laura     Manhattan           East Harlem       40.8\n 6  5099 Large Coz…    7322 Chris     Manhattan           Murray Hill       40.7\n 7  5121 BlissArts…    7356 Garon     Brooklyn            Bedford-Stuy…     40.7\n 8  5178 Large Fur…    8967 Shunichi  Manhattan           Hell's Kitch…     40.8\n 9  5203 Cozy Clea…    7490 MaryEllen Manhattan           Upper West S…     40.8\n10  5238 Cute & Co…    7549 Ben       Manhattan           Chinatown         40.7\n# ℹ 48,885 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: longitude <dbl>, room_type <chr>, price <dbl>,\n#   minimum_nights <dbl>, number_of_reviews <dbl>, last_review <date>,\n#   reviews_per_month <dbl>, calculated_host_listings_count <dbl>,\n#   availability_365 <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlatest_dates <- select(arrange(ab_nyc, desc(last_review)), \"last_review\")\nlatest_dates\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 48,895 × 1\n   last_review\n   <date>     \n 1 2019-07-08 \n 2 2019-07-08 \n 3 2019-07-08 \n 4 2019-07-08 \n 5 2019-07-08 \n 6 2019-07-08 \n 7 2019-07-08 \n 8 2019-07-08 \n 9 2019-07-08 \n10 2019-07-08 \n# ℹ 48,885 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis dataset provides location, lodging, and review information for Airbnb residences in New York. The data seems to be relatively recent because the latest date of last review for an Airbnb was in the middle of 2019. I will be recreating two of my graphs made from this dataset in Challenge 5.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nThis data is already tidy because each relevant variable has its own column, each case its own row, and each value its own cell.\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\nFor my analysis, all the required variables have the right data type and format, so there is no need for recoding or mutation.\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ab_nyc, aes(neighbourhood_group, fill = room_type)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Plot\", subtitle = \"Airbnb count by neighborhood groups\", x = \"Area\", y = \"Airbnb residence count\", fill = \"Room Type\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IshanBhardwaj_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis graph tells us which neighborhood groups in New York have the highest number of Airbnb residences. As seen, Manhattan and Brooklyn far outweigh the other locations with respect to this variable. This is useful as it can hint us to which areas of New York are more tourist-centric. I added the dimension of bar colors for the room types to this plot. I chose a bar graph here because I am measuring one categorical variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ab_nyc, aes(neighbourhood_group, number_of_reviews)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ neighbourhood_group, nrow = 2) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot Facets\", subtitle = \"Area vs No. of reviews\", x = \"Area\", y = \"No. of reviews\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IshanBhardwaj_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis plot tells us the trend of leaving reviews for each area, which indirectly tells us which areas had the most number of visits, as one review corresponds to a single stay at a residence. From here, we can see that Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens are all popular spots for stay as their range of review counts has the most population and variation. Their box plots are quite populated till the 400 reviews barrier, which is a considerably higher ceiling than that of The Bronx or Staten Island. I added the dimension of facets to this plot. I chose a box plot here because I am comparing a categorical and continuous variable.",
