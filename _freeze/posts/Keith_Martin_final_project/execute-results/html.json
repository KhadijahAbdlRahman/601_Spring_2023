Introduction {#describe-the-data-sets}\n\nSince California first legalized medical use of Marijuana in 1996, there have been twenty two states that have legalized Marijuana use in some capacity. As the prohibition fades away, the mad dash to enter into the industry began. Politicians and advocates argued that those who we're most heavily impacted by the \"War on Drugs\" should be considered for the first round of licensing. Simultaneously, large companies with business ties in the industry lobbied for licensing as well. \n\nAfter decades of decriminalization, states now have to decide who can distribute Marijuana in their state. The data used in this paper was gathered from Pennsylvania's phases 1 and 2 dispensary application report cards from PADOH in 2016. The PADOH evaluation was used by Pennsylvania state officials as an application process that resulted in a score out of 800 points. The 800 points were broken down into 16 categories each broken down into individual scores. \n\n### Research Questions\n\nIn this paper, I want to answer the following questions: \n\nDoes having higher capital score contribute to a higher chance in receiving a license?\n\nDo any other factors have a similar impact on receiving a license if final scores are similar?\n\n\n### Data\n\nThis data set was gathered from 387 applications submitted in Pennsylvania (2016) from various companies attempting to get a license to operate a dispensary in the state. \n\nEach case is a company (sometimes several applications from the same company) and their respective scores across 16 categories. The categories are diversity plan,\toperational time table,\tqualifications,\tsecurity\ttransportation,\tstorage,\tlabeling,\tinventory,\tdiversion,\tsanitation,\trecord keeping,\thistory,\tcapital,\tcommunity,\tsite plan and\tpersonalid.\n\nThese scores are then added up for a total score, the max being 800. In theory, the higher your total score, the higher chance you will receive a license.\n\nThe categories I will be focusing on are capital, qualifications, security and diversity plan.\n\nFor visualization, I will use scatterplots, boxplots and a correlogram  to visualize any potential patterns between specific categories and whether or not they received a license. \n\nFor the purpose of this paper, we will be focusing on the correlation and potential patterns. However, regression will not be used. We will not prove statistical significance, but to use these observations as inspiration for further future research. \n\nN/A values will be removed because they are random throughout the data set and incomplete application packages were not considered for a license. Therefore any company that did not have an N/A in any category, would not have been considered for a license. \n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAfter reviewing the data, it becomes evident that the company with the higher scores do not always receive licenses. Some with lower scores receive them and some with higher scores in specific categories receive licenses despite having a lower total score. \n\nI hypothesize that if you we're to separate the higher scores in the capital category you would find that companies with more capital will receive licenses even if their overall score is not the highest.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that the diversity plan will show lower levels of correlation than capital.\n\n\n### Read in the Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

These are the categories that are going to be used for the bivariate analyses below.\n\n### Mutate \n\nSince the licensed data was originally logged as 0 for companies that did not receive a license and 1 for companies that received a license, I needed to mutate the values to string format. This allows for clearer visualizations. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated<-PA_Dispensary_License_Condensed%>%\nmutate(licensed = ifelse(licensed==0, \"Unlicensed\", \"Licensed\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Summary Statistics \n\nDiversity Plan Statistics:\n\nFigure 1\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Summary Statistics for Diversity Plan Licensed v.

As you can see on average, licensed dispensaries had a score of 54.3, while unlicensed had an average score of 43.5. The median shared similar results. The median score for licensed dispensaries was 53.5 and unlicensed dispensaries had a median score of 40. The most interesting observation based on the summary statistics is the maximum for both unlicensed dispensaries and licensed dispensaries was both 75. That is the highest you could score in this category. This shows that even dispensaries that received the highest possible score in regards to diversity plan, did not always receive a license.\n\nIn addition to the summary statistics, I included a box plot with underlying violin plots to further describe the distribution and statistics.\n\nFigure 2\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n###Box and Violin Combined for Diversity and Awarded\nggplot(PA_Dispensary_License_Mutated, aes(diversityplan, \n       y= awarded, fill = licensed)) +\n    geom_violin(width=1.4) +\n    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, color=\"grey\", alpha=0.2) +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n    theme_ipsum() +\n    theme(\n      legend.position=\"none\",\n      plot.title = element_text(size=11)\n    )+\n  labs(title = \"Diversity Score for License\", x=\"Diversity Plan Score\", y=\"Awarded Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe visualization in Figure 2 builds on the results from the above summary statistics. As you can see from the box plots, the range of the unlicensed dispensaries (Yellow) encompasses the majority of the range from licensed dispensaries (Purple). Additionally, there is a significant amount of overlap of the violin plots. This suggests that there are a considerable amount of scores that overlap that either received or did not receive a license. There is no clear patterns.\n\n\nQualification Statistics:\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n###Summary Statistics for Qualifications and Licensed\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\n  group_by(licensed)%>%\n  summarise(\n      sd_qual = sd (qualifications, na.rm=TRUE),\n      max_qual = max(qualifications, na.rm = TRUE),\n      min_qual = min(qualifications, na.rm = TRUE),\n      avg_qualification = mean (qualifications, na.rm = TRUE),\n      med_qualification = median(qualifications, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"licensed\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"sd_qual\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"max_qual\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"min_qual\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"avg_qualification\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"med_qualification\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Licensed\",\"2\":\"3.365727\",\"3\":\"42\",\"4\":\"28.0\",\"5\":\"34.8030\",\"6\":\"34.92\"},{\"1\":\"Unlicensed\",\"2\":\"6.190496\",\"3\":\"45\",\"4\":\"8.2\",\"5\":\"30.1568\",\"6\":\"30.80\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\nFigure 3 is the summary statistics for the qualification scores for unlicensed and licensed dispensaries.

Based on the summary statistics, I expect there to be a more distinguishable pattern between the security score, the total points awarded and whether or not they received a license.\n\nFigure 6:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(PA_Dispensary_License_Mutated, aes(security, \n       y= awarded, fill = licensed)) +\n    geom_violin(width=1.4) +\n    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, color=\"grey\", alpha=0.2) +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n    theme_ipsum() +\n    theme(\n      legend.position=\"none\",\n      plot.title = element_text(size=11)\n    )+\n  labs(title = \"Average Security Score for License\", x=\"Security Score\", y=\"Awarded Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see in Figure 7, there is noticeably less overlap on the violin plots across the x-axis.

This category will require further visualization and analysis before we can conclude there is a pattern.\n\nCapital Statistics:\n\nFigure 7\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n###Summary Statistics for Capital and Licensed\n\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\n  group_by(licensed)%>%\n  summarise(\n      sd_capital = sd (capital, na.rm=TRUE),\n      max_capital = max(capital, na.rm = TRUE),\n      min_capital = min(capital, na.rm = TRUE),\n      avg_capital = mean (capital, na.rm = TRUE),\n      med_capital = median(capital, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"licensed\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"sd_capital\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"max_capital\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"min_capital\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"avg_capital\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"med_capital\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Licensed\",\"2\":\"4.955124\",\"3\":\"72.6\",\"4\":\"52.17\",\"5\":\"62.59296\",\"6\":\"62.67\"},{\"1\":\"Unlicensed\",\"2\":\"12.394399\",\"3\":\"72.6\",\"4\":\"10.20\",\"5\":\"52.37786\",\"6\":\"56.10\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the summary statistics for capital scores between licensed and unlicensed dispensaries. The notable observations are that the average licensed score(62.6) and the median licensing score (62.7) are almost the same. This suggests the violin plots will have a similar distribution to that observed with the security score.   \n\nFigure 8\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(PA_Dispensary_License_Mutated, aes(capital, \n       y= awarded, fill = licensed)) +\n    geom_violin(width=1.4) +\n    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, color=\"grey\", alpha=0.2) +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n    theme_ipsum() +\n    theme(\n      legend.position=\"none\",\n      plot.title = element_text(size=11)\n    )+\n  labs(title = \"Capital Score for License\", x=\"Capital Score\", y=\"Awarded Score\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nLike Figure 6, there is less overlap between the capital score across the x-axis. This observation suggests that there is a pattern between a higher capital score and receiving a license. This hints at a possible correlation between the capital score and licensing outcome.\n\nTotal Awarded:\nFigure 9\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n###Total Awarded and Licensed Summary Stats\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\n  group_by(licensed)%>%\n  summarise(\n      sd_awarded = sd (awarded, na.rm=TRUE),\n      max_awarded = max(awarded, na.rm = TRUE),\n      min_awarded = min(awarded, na.rm = TRUE),\n      avg_awarded = mean (awarded, na.rm = TRUE),\n      med_awarded = median(awarded, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"licensed\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"sd_awarded\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"max_awarded\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"min_awarded\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"avg_awarded\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"med_awarded\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Licensed\",\"2\":\"40.5951\",\"3\":\"771.5\",\"4\":\"594.1\",\"5\":\"682.9314\",\"6\":\"686.05\"},{\"1\":\"Unlicensed\",\"2\":\"111.6727\",\"3\":\"760.3\",\"4\":\"132.6\",\"5\":\"560.0212\",\"6\":\"589.60\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see from the \"min awarded\" in Figure 9, the lowest score that received a license was 594, however, the highest score that did not receive a license was 760. This further shows evidence that the total score awarded is not the sole factor in whether or not a company receives a dispensary license. Additionally, the maximum for licensed dispensaries was 772 and the max for unlicensed dispensaries was 760. This hints at the fact that the higher the total points awarded does not necessarily result in obtaining a license. However, it is worth noting that the average licensed dispensary receives a score over 120 points higher than dispensaries that did not receive their license. \n\n\nFigure 10\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  ggplot(PA_Dispensary_License_Mutated, aes(licensed, \n       y= awarded, fill=licensed)) +\n  geom_violin(width=1.4)+\n    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, color=\"black\", alpha=0.2)+\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of Total Points Awarded\", x= \"Licensing Outcome\", y=\"Total Points Awarded\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure 10 further displays the overlap in total awarded points in dispensaries that received a license and those that did not. As you can see by the underlying violin plot, there noticeable overlap in scores.\n\nI focused on approximately 5 different categories. Specifically, I focused on name, diversity plan, qualifications, security, capital, licensed, awarded. The reason we focused on these categories is because I believe these are the most important scores when determining whether or not a company will receive a license.\n\nNext, I analyzed Scatterplot graphs to further investigate if there are patterns between categories. Additionally, I summarized the results with a correlogram that calculated the levels of correlation between the grouped categories.\n\n### Visualization \n\nI decided to include an outlier function to list any outiers in the scatter plot. After the outliers were removed, I separated the licensed dispensaries from the licensed dispensaries using a facet wrap to further analyze any potential patterns.  \n\nCapital vs. Awarded\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Outlier Function\nis_outlier <- function(x) \n  return(x < quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm=TRUE) - 1.5 * IQR(x, na.rm=TRUE) | x > quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm=TRUE) + 1.5 * IQR(x, na.rm=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### attempted outlier function on Scatterplot\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\n  mutate(outlier_capital = is_outlier(capital),\n         outlier_lab = if_else(outlier_capital, name, NA))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=capital, y=awarded, col = licensed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label=outlier_lab), col=\"red\")+\n  scale_color_discrete(name=\"Licensed\")+\n  labs(title= \"Scatterplot of Capital and Total Points Awarded\", x= \"Capital Score\", y = \"Total Points Awarded\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nAs you can see from the general shape of Figure 11, there seems to be a distinct correlation between the capital score and licensing outcome when compared to the total points awarded.\n\n\nFigure 12\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n###Facet Wrap Graph Capital\n  ggplot(PA_Dispensary_License_Mutated, aes(x=capital, y=awarded, col = licensed)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(40, 80))+\n  labs(title= \"Scatterplot of Capital and Total Points Awarded\", x= \"Capital Score\", y = \"Total Points Awarded\")+\n  scale_color_discrete(name=\"Licensed\")+\n  facet_wrap(vars(licensed))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn figure 12, you will notice that there is a noticeable positive correlation for both licensed and unlicensed dispensaries. It is worth noting that there is a strong positive correlation from unlicensed dispensaries compared to the dispensaries that received licenses. This is likely due to the fact that are simply significantly more dispensaries that did not receive a license. \n\nDiversity vs. Total Points Awarded\n\nFigure 13\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n###Diversity scatterplot\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\n  mutate(outlier_diversity = is_outlier(diversityplan),\n         outlier_lab = if_else(outlier_diversity, name, NA))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=diversityplan, y=awarded, col = licensed)) +\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_color_discrete(name=\"Licensed\")+\n  labs(title= \"Scatterplot of Diversity and Total Points Awarded\", x= \"Diversity Score\", y = \"Total Points Awarded\")+\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label=outlier_lab), col=\"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAt first glance of Figure 13, I noticed that there was a significant amount of overlap between the licensing outcome when compared to diversity scores.

The outliers are specified in the above Scatterplot. After reviewing the graph, it seems that security has a very strong positive correlation. The shape more closely resembles the distribution of the capital score than the other grouped factors.\n\nFigure 18\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=security, y=awarded, col = as.factor(licensed))) +\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_color_discrete(name=\"Licensed\")+\n  labs(title= \"Scatterplot of Security and Total Points Awarded\", x= \"Security Score\", y = \"Total Points Awarded\")+\n  facet_wrap(vars(licensed))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn Figure 18, I separated the two outcomes using a facet wrap. As you can see, the licensed plot seems to have the strongest correlation of the observed categories. This suggests that the security score is one of the more important scores when it comes to licensing outcomes.\n\n###Final Look\n\nThis final correlogram provide additional visualization and the actual levels of correlation for the specified categories. In the below graph \"licensed\" was changed to \"Lic\"(Red) and \"Unlicensed\" was changed to \"Unl\"(Blue).\n\nIn addition to the correlation calculations, Figure 19 includes additional visualizations that align with the observations made above. The distributions and patterns in the additional visualizations share similar results. \n\nFigure 19\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPA_Dispensary_License_Mutated%>%\nmutate(licensed = ifelse(licensed==\"Unlicensed\", \"Unl.\", \"Lic.\"))%>%\n  ggpairs(., columns = 2:7,\n        ggplot2::aes(col = licensed))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on Figure 19, Security score has the strongest positive correlation for both licensed and unlicensed dispensaries, followed by capital score. The security score has a very strong general correlation(.910) and a moderately strong correlation (.616) for licensed dispensaries. The capital score shares a similar result with a moderately strong licensed correlation(.525) and very strong overall correlation ( .868). It is worth noting that diversity plan has a slightly stronger licensed correlation (.249) that the qualification score(.185), but the general graph was slightly less correlated overall(.629 vs .780). \n\nAdditionally, the graph shows the correlations when compared to the other categories. However, for the purpose of this paper I focused on the awarded column. \n\nI chose these types of visualization because they offer the clearest picture between companies that received licenses and those that did not. Also, with scatterplots, you can see if there is a cluster hovering near a specific value. Box plots provide a similar result as we compared the total scores, the category and whether or a company received a license. \n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I observed that the most noticeable patterns are between capital scores and security scores. However, since I did not test for statistical significance, these patterns will require further analysis. That being said, based on the above visualizations and calculations, capital and diversity score seem to have the most impact on the licensing outcome. \n\nThe impact of the diversity plan or the qualifications does not seem to produce as convincing results. I believe that tests for statistical significance would affirm this. However, the purpose of this analysis was to determine if there are any patterns between the mentioned categories. An additional statistical analysis and study is required to conclusively prove the results.\n\n\n### Bibliography\n\nHannah, Lee, 2022, \"Replication Data for \"Maximizing Social Equity as a Pillar of Public Administration: An Examination of Cannabis Dispensary Licensing in Pennsylvania\"\", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KYT5PD, Harvard Dataverse, V1; PA Dispensary License Data.tab\n\nR Core Team (2017).
