And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n-   eggs ⭐\n-   abc_poll ⭐⭐\n-   australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n-   hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n-   air_bnb ⭐⭐⭐\n-   us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n-   faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf<-read_csv(\"_data/eggs_tidy.csv\")\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  month     year large_half_dozen large_dozen extra_large_half_dozen extra_lar…¹\n  <chr>    <dbl>            <dbl>       <dbl>                  <dbl>       <dbl>\n1 January   2004             126         230                    132         230 \n2 February  2004             128.        226.                   134.        230 \n3 March     2004             131         225                    137         230 \n4 April     2004             131         225                    137         234.\n5 May       2004             131         225                    137         236 \n6 June      2004             134.        231.                   137         241 \n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​extra_large_dozen\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nThe data is already tidy. It has a clear structure where each row represents a unique observation (month and year), and each column represents a variable (large_half_dozen, large_dozen, extra_large_half_dozen, and extra_large_dozen) with its corresponding values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\\\n\nthere are no variables that require mutation to be usable in an analysis stream. The variables are already numerical, and no string values need to be converted into numerical values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df, aes(x = large_half_dozen, y = extra_large_half_dozen)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Large Half Dozen\", y = \"Extra Large Half Dozen\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NisargShah_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df, aes(x = paste(month, year), y = extra_large_dozen)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Extra Large Dozen Sold\",\n       title = \"Trend of Extra Large Dozens Sold\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NisargShah_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a scatter plot with color indicating the month\nggplot(df, aes(x = large_dozen, y = extra_large_dozen)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = month), size = 4, shape = 21, fill = \"white\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Month\") +\n  labs(x = \"Large Dozen\", y = \"Extra Large Dozen\",\n       title = \"Extra Large vs Large Dozens Sold\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NisargShah_challenge7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
