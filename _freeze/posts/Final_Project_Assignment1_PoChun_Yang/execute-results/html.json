Abstraction {#describe-the-data-sets}\n\nAnalyzing the performance data of NBA players is an interesting and important task for basketball enthusiasts and professionals alike. In this analysis, we focused on several factors that could potentially influence player performance, including physical characteristics, education, age, drafted status, and drafted round.\n\nFirstly, we explored the relationship between physical characteristics, such as height, and performance indicators such as rebound and assist. The visualization results showed a strong correlation between height and rebound, but a weaker correlation with assist.\n\nNext, we examined the relationship between age and scoring ability, which showed a downward trend as players get older. This suggests that younger players tend to perform better than older players in terms of scoring.\n\nIn addition, we analyzed the drafted status and drafted round of players. The results indicated that drafted players tend to have better scoring and rebound abilities compared to non-drafted players. Moreover, the first-round draft picks have a higher median score than the later rounds.\n\nLastly, we looked at the education of NBA players and how it relates to their performance. The visualization results showed that college and high school players have similar scoring abilities, but high school players tend to have slightly higher rebound abilities.\n\nOverall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that may affect the performance of NBA players. These findings can be useful for coaches, scouts, and fans alike in evaluating and predicting player performance.\n\n## 2. Introduction\n\nI have been a devoted follower of basketball for as long as I can remember, and I have always been eager to merge my love for the sport with my interest in data analysis. To achieve this, I used the NBA Stats API to collect a dataset that I believe will be just as captivating for you to work with as it has been for me.\n\n-   What factors determine players' performance(point, rebound, assist, net_rating)?\n\n**physical characteristics**\n\nI started by analyzing the performance data of NBA players in relation to their physical characteristics, such as their height. It's intriguing to see how their height correlates with their rebounding ability, assist rate, and other performance metrics. Additionally, I also examined whether age has an impact on players' performance.\n\n**education and background**\n\nI carried out an analysis to compare the performance of drafted and non-drafted players. Subsequently, I proceeded to analyze the performance of players drafted in different rounds. Upon examining the data, it was noteworthy that the final round of the draft is the third round.\n\nAdditionally, I conducted an analysis of the correlation between education and the performance of NBA players. It was fascinating to discover whether there is a difference in performance between players who played in the NCAA and those who played in high school.\n\n-   After the above analysis and visualization, I analyze some of Trivia facts of personal interests.\n\n**Analysis of several my favorite players**\n\nTo begin with, I am interested in exploring the careers of my favorite players and analyzing their data. I am not particularly interested in following new star players, so I will analyze the data for their careers. My aim is to gain a deeper understanding of their performances through this report.\n\n**Analysis of Height and Weight of NBA Players**\n\nAdditionally, I want to use the data to analyze the body mass index (BMI) of players. I am interested in exploring whether players who have a high weight are more prone to injuries than players who have a lower BMI. However, this data does not provide injure data. Thus, I would analysis of players with high BMI and investigate how often they are injured.\n\n## 3. Describe the data set(s) {#describe-the-data-sets-1}\n\nThe dataset that I have compiled using the NBA Stats API includes information on all players who have been a part of an NBA team's roster for the past twenty years. It encompasses various demographic variables such as age, height, weight, and place of birth, along with biographical details like the team they played for, draft year, and round. Furthermore, the dataset contains fundamental box score statistics, such as the number of games played, average points, rebounds, assists, and other relevant information.\n\n1.  read the dataset;\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read_csv(\"Po-chunYang_FinalProjectData/all_seasons.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe 23 column show players' name, team abbreviation, age, height, weight, college, country, draft round, draft number, games played, points, rebound, assist, net rating, Offensive Rebounds, Defensive Rebounds, Usage Percentage, True Shooting Percentage, Assists Percentage, and season.

The Tentative Plan for Visualization {#the-tentative-plan-for-visualization}\n\n-   Height and **rebound** relative analysis I am curious to investigate whether height has an impact on a player's rebound skills. I want to determine if there is evidence to support this theory or not. In addition, I would like to conduct an analysis to determine whether a basketball player's height has a significant influence on their points and assists data.\n\nAs we all know, the center position in basketball is the key player responsible for the team's rebounding. Since players in this position are usually taller than others, I have decided to analyze the correlation between height and rebounding ability using the dataset. Based on the scatterplot diagram below, it is evident that taller players tend to have better rebounding skills. However, interestingly, there seems to be a slight decline in the rebounding performance of players between 220cm to 225cm, which could be attributed to mobility issues caused by being excessively tall.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nHeight_rebound<-performance%>%\n  select(player_name,height,average_rebound)\nggplot(data=Height_rebound, aes(x=height, y=average_rebound)) + \n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"height(cm)\")+\n  ylab(\"rebound\")+\n  labs(title=\"height and rebound correlation\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  stat_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Final_Project_Assignment1_PoChun_Yang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the visualization, it appears that a basketball player's height has little correlation with their scoring ability. In fact, the visualization shows that shorter players tend to have better scoring ability. It is cool to know about that.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheight_points<-performance%>%\n  select(player_name,height,average_point)\nggplot(data=height_points, aes(x=height, y=average_point)) + \n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"height(cm)\")+\n  ylab(\"point\")+\n  labs(title=\"height and point correlation\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  stat_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Final_Project_Assignment1_PoChun_Yang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the visualization, it appears that a basketball player's height may have a significant impact on their assist ability. Taller players do not seem to have as strong of an assist ability as their shorter counterparts. In fact, the visualization shows that shorter players tend to have significantly higher assist numbers. This is exemplified by the fact that many point guards, who are responsible for organizing the team's offense, are typically shorter in height. Therefore, they have higher assist numbers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheight_assist<-performance%>%\n  select(player_name,height,average_assist)\nggplot(data=height_assist, aes(x=height, y=average_assist)) + \n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"height(cm)\")+\n  ylab(\"assist\")+\n  labs(title=\"height and assist correlation\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  stat_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Final_Project_Assignment1_PoChun_Yang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the visualization, it shows that a basketball player's height has little correlation with their net rating. Net rating primarily reflects a player's performance on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court. As different positions require different roles, players of varying heights can excel as long as they fulfill their primary responsibilities. For instance, taller players may be responsible for rebounding, while shorter players may contribute more to ball handling and shooting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheight_rating<-performance%>%\n  select(player_name,height,net_rating)\nggplot(data=height_rating, aes(x=height, y=net_rating)) + \n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"height(cm)\")+\n  ylab(\"net_rating\")+\n  labs(title=\"height and net_rating correlation\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  stat_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Final_Project_Assignment1_PoChun_Yang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   Analysis players **age with their net rating** I want to explore the impact of age on player performance. I would like to investigate whether age has a significant effect on the performance of players or not.\n\nAfter analyzing the relationship between age and net_rating, it is evident from the chart that there is not a significant correlation between the two variables. It is possible that individual players assess their physical fitness and performance data each season and make the decision to retire if they feel it is necessary. As a result, net_rating may not necessarily decrease significantly due to age alone.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nage_performance<- dp%>%\n  filter(net_rating<20)%>%\n  filter(net_rating>-20)%>%\n  select(age, net_rating)\n  boxplot(net_rating~age, data = age_performance, xlab = \"age\",\n   ylab = \"Net_rating\", main = \"performance\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Final_Project_Assignment1_PoChun_Yang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the visualization, it appears that age may have an impact on a basketball player's rebounding ability.

Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis of NBA players' performance data reveals some interesting insights. The correlation between physical characteristics such as height and performance factors such as rebounding and assisting provides valuable information for coaches and teams. The analysis also shows that age does not have a significant impact on performance, which may be surprising to some. Additionally, the comparison of drafted and non-drafted players' performance indicates that drafted players generally perform better than non-drafted players, and the third round appears to be the least impactful round for drafting players. Finally, the analysis of education and performance suggests that players who played in the NCAA perform slightly worse than those who entered the league directly from high school. These findings can be useful for teams and players in developing strategies to improve their performance and maximize their potential in the NBA.\n",
