Today, there\nis overwhelmingly easy access to alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine, and\nthey have all evolved in their own ways to become very socially\naccepted. We will look at which of these negative variables, as well as\na more positive variable (exercise), affect sleeping trends in young\nindividuals, aged 21-35. The data set, which I will discuss in greater\ndetail below, analyzes sleep efficiency and time spent sleeping. It also\nnotes whether or not/how much alcohol and caffeine was consumed the\nprior day. Additionally, it looks at frequency of exercise, and whether\nor not the individual smokes. All this combined will enable us to draw\ninsights on what some drivers of poor or strong sleep efficiency are.\nDoing so may curate actionable results for individuals looking to\nimprove sleep efficiency and duration by taking into account the\nfindings here. As someone who has slept poorly essentially forever, I am\nvery interested to see what trends emerge.\n\n# Data Set Introduction & Background\n\nThe data set contains information about a group of test subjects and\ntheir sleep patterns. Each test subject is identified by a unique\n\"Subject ID\" and their age and gender are also recorded. The \"Bedtime\"\nand \"Wake-up time\" features indicate when each subject goes to bed and\nwakes up each day, and the \"Sleep duration\" feature records the total\namount of time each subject slept in hours. The \"Sleep efficiency\"\nfeature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is\nactually spent asleep. The \"REM sleep percentage\", \"Deep sleep\npercentage\", and \"Light sleep percentage\" features indicate the amount\nof time each subject spent in each stage of sleep. The \"Awakenings\"\nfeature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the\nnight. Additionally, the data set includes information about each\nsubject's caffeine and alcohol consumption in the 24 hours prior to\nbedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency. This will\nall be outlined in a descriptive table down below, with the addition of\nmeasurement scale.\n\nThe data set provided was collected as part of a study conducted in the\nUK by a research team from The University of Oxfordshire[^1]. The study\naimed to investigate the impact of lifestyle factors such as caffeine,\nalcohol, and exercise on sleep patterns and sleep quality. The research\nteam recruited participants from the local community and collected data\nover a period of several months. The data was collected using a\ncombination of self-reported surveys, actigraphy, and polysomnography\nwhich is a sleep monitoring technique. The data was then analyzed to\nunderstand the relationship between lifestyle factors and sleep patterns\nand to identify any potential areas for intervention to improve sleep.\n\n[^1]: \"Sleep Efficiency Dataset.\" University of Oxfordshire , 14 Jan.\n    2023\n\nI am interested in finding sleep inhibitors for young adults, so I'll\nfilter for ages from 21-35. I would like to look at those under 35 more\ngenerally, but I cannot go below 21 because nicotineand alcohol are not\nlegally available for individuals under the age of 21. The results,\ntherefor, could be erroneous without filtering out below 21. Also note,\n35 was an abstract selection and where I chose the cut-off for \"young\nadults\", although this is not an objectively true measure of \"young\", of\ncourse.\n\n# Data Description\n\nI am loading in the raw data, which is rather tidy to begin with. I will\nbe altering the data to fit my specific analysis, but spending a bit\nmore time analyzing and less cleaning. Any NAs will be dropped and\ndisregarded, because there is a very slim percentage of NAs present in\nthe dataset, so the results will not be impacted from disregarding them.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"C:/Github Projects/601_Spring_2023/posts\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Set wd to folder with data\nsetwd(\"C:/Github Projects/601_Spring_2023/posts/ConnorLandreth_FinalProjectData\")\n#read in raw sleep data\nsleep <- read.csv(\"Sleep_Efficiency.csv\")\n#View(sleep)\n#head(sleep)\n#View Dimensions of dataframe \ndim(sleep)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 452  15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDimensions on the raw sleep data include 452 observations over 15\nvariables\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#evaluate unique values and summarize to evaluate number of respondents, age range, and gender options\nlength(unique(sleep$ID))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 452\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(sleep$Age))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 61\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(unique(sleep$Gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#I am going to remove bedtime and wakeup time, as the information is irrelevant for this analysis and is encapsulated in the sleep duration column.

Next, I'll explore the consumption trends for efficient\nsleepers between the ages of 21-35.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(n_sleep)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Age           Gender          Sleep.duration   Sleep.efficiency\n Min.   :21.00   Length:155         Min.   : 5.000   Min.   :0.5000  \n 1st Qu.:25.00   Class :character   1st Qu.: 7.000   1st Qu.:0.7100  \n Median :27.00   Mode  :character   Median : 7.500   Median :0.8200  \n Mean   :27.63                      Mean   : 7.497   Mean   :0.7838  \n 3rd Qu.:30.00                      3rd Qu.: 8.000   3rd Qu.:0.9000  \n Max.   :35.00                      Max.   :10.000   Max.   :0.9800  \n                                                                     \n   Awakenings    Caffeine.consumption Alcohol.consumption Smoking.status    \n Min.   :0.000   Min.   :  0.00       Min.   :0.000       Length:155        \n 1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.:  0.00       1st Qu.:0.000       Class :character  \n Median :1.000   Median : 25.00       Median :0.000       Mode  :character  \n Mean   :1.608   Mean   : 32.93       Mean   :1.291                         \n 3rd Qu.:3.000   3rd Qu.: 50.00       3rd Qu.:2.000                         \n Max.   :4.000   Max.   :200.00       Max.   :5.000                         \n NA's   :7       NA's   :10           NA's   :7                             \n Exercise.frequency\n Min.   :0.000     \n 1st Qu.:1.000     \n Median :1.000     \n Mean   :1.656     \n 3rd Qu.:2.000     \n Max.   :5.000     \n NA's   :4         \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The mean sleep efficiency for these individuals is .7889, so I will make that the baseline for \"good\" sleep efficiency\n  \n\nn_sleep %>% \n  filter(Sleep.efficiency >= \".7889\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Alcohol.consumption,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender))+\n  geom_jitter(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Alcohol Consumption', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Alcohol Consumption & Sleep Efficiency by Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Submission_Final_Project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/S.E._Alcohol-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese results show, generally speaking, there is a trend that shows more\nalcoholic drinks translating to less sleep efficiency for both males and\nfemales. Males do show a resurgence in sleep efficiency from 2 to 3\ndrinks, then even goes on to gradually increase as intoxication goes up.\nThe way I interpret this is that women in the sample all experience\nreduced sleep efficiency the more they drink, but for men, two drinks\nactually sees the nadir of sleep efficiency.\n\nPerhaps because the mind often becomes more active off of 1-2 drinks,\nmen are experiencing increased mental stimulus and activity, making it\nharder to sleep[^2]. Then as they get up to 3-4 drinks (likely a bit\ndrunk and relaxed), efficiency goes back up, but still not as high as it\nwould be with no drinks. So in conclusion, 3 drinks doesn't see the\nworst sleep efficiency, but the highest efficiency comes from no alcohol\nat all.\n:::\n\n[^2]: Leadem, Rose. \"11 Ways Drinking Alcohol Can Make You Smarter,\n    Healthier and More Creative.\" Entrepreneur, 25 Oct. 2017,\n    www.entrepreneur.com/living/11-ways-drinking-alcohol-can-make-you-smarter-healthier/303584\n\nNow we will look at the other variables below.\n\n::: {#AllOtherVariables .panel-tabset}\n### Question 2: Other Variables\n\nThis section will answer my second question, 'What are the main\ninhibitors of sleep efficiency?'\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sleep %>% \n    filter(Sleep.efficiency >= \".7889\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Caffeine.consumption,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender))+\n  geom_jitter(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  #width = x\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Caffeine Consumption', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Caffeine Consumption & Sleep Efficiency by Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Submission_Final_Project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/S.E._Caffeine-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese are interesting results. For females, the most caffeine any of\nthese high-efficiency-sleeping women consume a day is 75mg, and most\nconsume less. For the few young women who do consume 75mg, their average\nsleep efficiency is the highest. I would be inclined to surmise that\ncaffeine effects them little, or they drink it only in the early\nmorning.\n\nFor men, most consume none, but oddly, as consumption increases, so too\ndoes sleep efficiency. Again though, much likely has to do with time of\nday caffeine is consumed, so I am inclined to once again believe these\nindividuals aren't effected much by caffeine, so are able to consume\nmore. Overall though, all of these high-efficiency-sleepers consume a\nreasonable amount, and sleep very well. Thirdly, we'll look at exercise.\nHow often are these efficient sleepers exercising?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#since we mutated gender to be binary earlier, we will revert back to the original names of 'male', 'female' for the visualization. \n#n_sleep$Gender[sleep$Gender==\"0\"] <- \"Male\"\n#n_sleep$Gender[sleep$Gender==\"1\"] <- \"Female\"\n\nn_sleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Exercise.frequency,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender))+\n  geom_jitter(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Exercise Frequency', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Exercise Frequency & Sleep Efficiency by Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Submission_Final_Project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/S.E._Exercise-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf this subset of male sleepers, the least efficient are those who do no\nexercise at all. For women, the least effiicient appear to exercise\nonece per week and most efficient female sleepers appear to exercise\nbetween 3-4 times per week. For men, The maximum amount of days these\nefficient sleepers exercised was 4 days. 4 days also led to maximum\nsleep efficiency at over 0.9. So, it appears for both men an women,\nalthough they follow different paths to get there, four days of exercise\nyields maximum sleep efficiency.\n\nLastly, I will take a look at smoking category. First, I will use\nn_sleep data set to look at all efficiency, then filter for smoking and\nsee if the trends change. I would imagine those who smoke wake up more\noften and sleep less efficiently because their body is craving\nnicotine/. We will look at two sets of boxplots. First is derived from\nthe original raw data and includes all 452 subjects. It splits up by\ngender again and looks at smokers vs. non-smokers sleep efficiency.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#For the binary smoking, boxplots will help us see the mean sleep efficiency between smokers and non-smokers mroe easily. \nsleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Smoking.status,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender, fill = Gender))+\n  geom_boxplot(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Smoking Status', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Smoking Status & Sleep Efficiency by Gender (Whole Data Set)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Submission_Final_Project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/S.E._Smoking_OG-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe following set of boxplots references n_sleep, and therefor\nspecifically 21-35 year old individuals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_sleep %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Smoking.status,Sleep.efficiency, color=Gender, fill = Gender))+\n  geom_boxplot(size=2, alpha = 0.5)+\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~Gender)+\n  labs(x='Smoking Status', y='Sleep Efficiency') +\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  labs(title=\"Smoking Status & Sleep Efficiency by Gender (21-35)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Submission_Final_Project_ConnorLandreth_files/figure-html/S.E._Smoking_new-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn general, young adults (aged 21-35) saw enhanced sleep efficiency\n(proportion of time spent in bed actually spent asleep) when they had\nhigher exercise rates and lower alcohol consumption (with the male 2-3\ndrink caveat). The genesis of this analysis is that exercise for anyone\n(male or female) can promote higher sleep efficiency, that amount of\nexercise will likely vary from person to person. For young men, smoking\nis a major sleep inhibitor. For young women, alcohol appears to be the\ngreatest sleep inhibitor. The remaining paragraphs blow will draw\nfurther conclusions from the analysis for each specific variable.\n\nThe fact 2-3 drinks leads to slightly better sleep in men is not a\npromotion or sign to go drink alcohol every night. This evidence\nactually suggests that while alcohol may help you get to sleep quicker,\nit often leads to reduced sleep quality.[^3] For women and men both,\nzero drinks saw optimal sleep quality. For women, every additional drink\nled to lower and lower quality sleep, with a very slight increase in\nquality around 5 drinks. It's probable that 5 drinks would lead a woman\nto a rather high level of intoxication and result in a much deeper sleep\nand the inability to even stay awake once their head hits the pillow.\nConsidering our definition of sleep efficiency (time in bed spent\nsleeping), the slight increase makes sense.\n\n[^3]: \\[1\\] Roehrs, T. and Roth, T., (2001) Sleep, sleepiness, and\n    alcohol use. Alcohol research and Health, 25(2), pp.101-109.\n\nNext, for caffeine, this data is not the most useful because the mass\nmajority of men consume zero caffeine and they have the worst sleep\nquality. Then we see an increase in sleep efficiency the more caffeine\nmen consume. Again, I think if the sample size were larger, we'd see a\ndifferent trend emerge, and that the high caffeine consumers are more\nimmune to caffeine or they consume solely in the early morning, so their\nsleep is hardly affected. Similarly, the female graph shows odd results.\nNo women consumed more than 75mg of caffeine. 0mg and 75mg show similar\nsleep quality with a substantial dip at 50mg. Similar to the men, the\nheavier consumers are in the minority, so the results may be skewed.\n\nFor smokers, we looked at the sample for all smokers/non-smokers and\nsmokers/non-smokers aged 21-35. For the entire data set, non-smoking\nfemales saw approximately 13% higher sleep efficiency than female\nsmokers, while the mean benefit for non-smoking men was negligible at\nonly \\~1-2%. For those aged 21-35, women saw a less substantial change,\nwith non-smoking females experiencing roughly a 5% higher sleep\nefficiency rate. Meanwhile, men saw a glaring difference, with\nnon-smoking men aged 21-35 operating at 83-84% mean sleep efficiency and\nsmoking men of the same age group seeing a mean of under 60%, which is\nfar worse off than non-smokers. This means that smoking is a massive\ninhibitor of sleep efficiency in young men. Smoker vs non-smoker sleep\nefficiency for women tightened with the age filter, but vastly widened\nfor men.\n\nLastly, for exercise, there is a sporadic/widespread sleep efficiency\nrecorded for all days listed. For example, men who worked out just one\nday showed superior sleep efficiency to men who worked out two days,\nthen the trend decreased further at three days before increasing greatly\nagain at four days. Despite this tumultuous journey across the graph\nplane, the line still tells us that from 1-4 days of working out, sleep\nefficiency was better for those individuals than it was for those who\ndidn't work out at all. So, we can't say how many days you should work\nout, but we can say you should try a different mix of days and be\ncognizant of your sleep quality week to week. One can likely find the\noptimal number of weekly workouts with this strategy, and the answer\ndoes not appear to be zero.\n\n# Limitations\n\nThe evidence against caffeine was inconclusive, but many caffeine\nconsumers were high-efficiency sleepers. Overall, a larger sample could\nhave led to a spread with greater validity, but I believe many of these\ntrends (alcohol, smoking, excessive) would likely be perpetuated with a\ngreater sample.\n\nAdditionally, we know people consumed alcohol and caffeine, but there is\nno data that tells us when they consumed it. That is a huge gap because\nif one drank 5 beers at between 11pm-12am, they'd probably pass out and\nhave high sleep efficiency vs someone who had 4 beers from the hours of\n1pm-10pm. Similarly for caffeine, someone drinking 75mg at 8am will not\nsleep at the same rate of efficiency as someone who consumed 75mg at\n10pm then proceeded to try try to sleep a couple hours later. The\ninclusion of this data could certainly lend to a more precise analysis.\n\n#### References\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2022).
