The dataset was likely gathered by the railroad company or perhaps one of the regulatory bodies governing the railroad. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad <-read_csv(\"_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\" )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe railroad data observations are for US by state/territory and county within respective state, with count of total employees for that county within that state. Total by number of observations are 2,930, and are in alphabetic order by state/territory, then alphabetic by county within each state/territory. \n\n\n# Specific views and statistics of the observations\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect(railroad, state, county, total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n   state county               total_employees\n   <chr> <chr>                          <dbl>\n 1 AE    APO                                2\n 2 AK    ANCHORAGE                          7\n 3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR               2\n 4 AK    JUNEAU                             3\n 5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA                  2\n 6 AK    SITKA                              1\n 7 AK    SKAGWAY MUNICIPALITY              88\n 8 AL    AUTAUGA                          102\n 9 AL    BALDWIN                          143\n10 AL    BARBOUR                            1\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see in the results above, and confirmed below, that this dataset contains a count of rows (2930) and columns (3).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(railroad)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2930    3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe dataset represents US States and counties. Specifically, the railroad data inlcudes 53 distinct state names. Since the count of state names is over 50, I conclude that the District of Columbia and US territories are likely included in the data observations. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad%>%\n  select (state) %>%\n  n_distinct(.)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 53\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nHow many counties have distinct names within this dataset? The answer indicates that some county names repeat across various states, as the total county names are not = 2930, the total number of observations. Noted for future communications to describe observations by both county and state for clarity.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad%>%\n  select(county)%>%\n  n_distinct(.)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1709\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWhich counties have the most employees within this set of observations? It appears that Illinois' Cook County has the highest count of employees, indicating this railroad has significant operations in Cook County, the home of the city of Chicago.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrange(railroad, desc(`total_employees`))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n   state county           total_employees\n   <chr> <chr>                      <dbl>\n 1 IL    COOK                        8207\n 2 TX    TARRANT                     4235\n 3 NE    DOUGLAS                     3797\n 4 NY    SUFFOLK                     3685\n 5 VA    INDEPENDENT CITY            3249\n 6 FL    DUVAL                       3073\n 7 CA    SAN BERNARDINO              2888\n 8 CA    LOS ANGELES                 2545\n 9 TX    HARRIS                      2535\n10 NE    LINCOLN                     2289\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWhich counties have the fewest employees of this railroad? Numerous counties have only 1 employee per county. When looking at the full dataset, 145 counties have only 1 employee. Future reports to provide breakdowns by designated ranges of employee count (eg: 1-50,50-100, etc.) using yet to be learned coding tools.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrange(railroad, `total_employees`)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n   state county   total_employees\n   <chr> <chr>              <dbl>\n 1 AK    SITKA                  1\n 2 AL    BARBOUR                1\n 3 AL    HENRY                  1\n 4 AP    APO                    1\n 5 AR    NEWTON                 1\n 6 CA    MONO                   1\n 7 CO    BENT                   1\n 8 CO    CHEYENNE               1\n 9 CO    COSTILLA               1\n10 CO    DOLORES                1\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWhich counties have more than 200 employees?

Combining the state and county fields for each observation will allow the existing data to be totalled by state using specific coding commands. Clean-up of the table results to be pursued. Additionally, graphic visualizations, and geo-graphics to be included in future reports.\n\n",
