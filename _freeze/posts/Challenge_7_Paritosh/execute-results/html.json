And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n-   eggs ⭐\n-   abc_poll ⭐⭐\n-   australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n-   hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n-   air_bnb ⭐⭐⭐\n-   us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n-   faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n## Visualization with Multiple Dimensions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nab_NYC %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = price, fill = room_type)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(title = \"Count of Airbnb Units in NYC by Price, Borough and Room Type\", \n       x = \"Price per Unit\", y = \"units per borough\", fill = \"Room Type\") + \n  facet_wrap(vars(neighbourhood_group), scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Challenge_7_Paritosh_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nab_NYC %>% \nggplot(aes(x = room_type, fill = room_type)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  aes(color = neighbourhood_group, fill = neighbourhood_group) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  xlab(\"Room Type\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of Units\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Units of each Room type\") +\n  labs(color = \"Neighbourhood Group\") +\n  guides(color = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Challenge_7_Paritosh_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nab_NYC %>% \n  group_by(neighbourhood_group, room_type, ) %>% \n  summarise(mean = mean(price)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(neighbourhood_group,mean,)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Average Price of Airbnb Units by NYC Borough and Room Type\", \n       x = \"Borough\", y = \"Average Price\") +\n  facet_wrap(vars(room_type)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", angle = 45, vjust = 0.5), \n        axis.text.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Challenge_7_Paritosh_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nab_NYC %>% \nggplot(aes(x = room_type, y = price, color = neighbourhood_group)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Prices by Borough and Room Type\", x = \"Room Type\", y = \"Price\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Challenge_7_Paritosh_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
