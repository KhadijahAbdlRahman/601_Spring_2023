For example, are all time variables correctly coded as dates? Are all string variables reduced and cleaned to sensible categories? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\n\nIt might be helpful, to facilitate calculations and visualizations, to code certain textual question answers as numeric. Here, I have coded two numeric variations of Q4 (one with a numeric version of the existing scale, and another which combines \"Good\" and \"Excellent as 2 and \"Not so good\" and \"Poor\" as 1).\n\nAdditionally, though these modifications do not use mutate, I modified the dataset to remove some irrelevant or redundant variables and to drop the unnecessary \"A\" or \"And\" in front of the party names in the original dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nabcpoll2 <- abcpoll %>%\n  select(-c(complete_status, ppemploy, Contact, weights_pid))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nabcpoll3 <- abcpoll2 %>% \n  separate(QPID, into = c(\"delete\", \"Party ID\"),sep = \"A |An \")\n\nabcpoll3 <- abcpoll3 %>%\n  replace_na(list(\"Party ID\" = \"Something else\"))\n\nabcpoll3 <- abcpoll3 %>%\n  select(-c(delete))\n\nabcpoll3 <- abcpoll3 %>%\n  mutate(Q4_num = recode(Q4, \"Excellent\" = 4, \"Good\" = 3, \"Not so good\" = 2, \"Poor\" = 1))\n\nabcpoll3 <- abcpoll3 %>%\n  mutate(Q4_combined = case_when(\n    Q4 == \"Excellent\" | Q4 == \"Good\" ~ 2, \n    Q4 == \"Not so good\" | Q4 == \"Poor\" ~ 1)\n  )\n```\n:::\n",
