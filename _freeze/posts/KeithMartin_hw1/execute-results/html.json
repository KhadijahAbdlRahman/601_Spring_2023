Please observe the following conventions:\n\n-   Save your own copy of this template as a blog post in the `posts` folder, naming it `FirstLast_hwX.qmd`\n-   Edit the yaml header to change your author name - use the same name each week\n-   include a *description* that is reader friendly\n-   update the *category* list to indicate the type of submission, the data used, the main packages or techniques, your name, or any thing else to make your document easy to find\n-   edit as a normal qmd/rmd file\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\ncomtrade <- read_csv (\"_data/AB_NYC_2019.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 48895 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (5): name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type\ndbl  (10): id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price, minimum_nights, number_o...\ndate  (1): last_review\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(comtrade)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in check_for_XQuartz(file.path(R.home(\"modules\"), \"R_de.so\")): X11 library is missing: install XQuartz from www.xquartz.org\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(2,3,4,5)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Rendering your post\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nBe sure that you have moved your `*.qmd` file into the `posts` folder **BEFORE** you render it, so that all files are stored in the correct location.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nOnly render a single file - don't try to render the whole website!\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Pilot Student Blogs\n\nWe are piloting a workflow including individual student websites with direted and limited pull requests back to course blogs. Please let us know if you would like to participate.\n:::\n\n## Reading in data files\n\nThe easiest data source to use - at least initially - is to choose something easily accessible, either from our `_data` folder provided, or from an online source that is publicly available.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Other Data\nIf you would like to use a source that you have access to and it is small enough and you don't mind making it public, you can copy it into the `_data` file and include in your *commit* and *pull request*.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Private Data\n\nIf you would like to use a proprietary source of data, that should be possible using the same process outlined above. There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!\n:::",
