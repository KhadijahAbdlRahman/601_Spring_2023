Introduction\n\nThe project aims to identify the leading causes of death across the world during the year 1990 to 2019\n\nGeneral Research Question: What is the leading cause of death across the world (including people from all demographics)? How did the causes of death change over time and differ between different countries and world regions?\n\nDataset Description: We use the data from The Global Burden of Disease which is a major global study that includes the annual number of deaths at the country level during the years - 1990 and 2019. Each row represents the annual deaths in a specific country for the specific disease or cause. The dataset covers a wide range of causes of death, including both communicable and non-communicable diseases, injuries, and other factors contributing to mortality rates. The dataset represents the annual death for all demographic characteristics.\n\nUnit of Analysis: Each row in the dataset represents the annual death numbers for the specific country during the mentioned year from the specified cause or disease. The dataset includes data of all the people irrespective of their demographic characteristics.\n\n## Part 2. Literature Review\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is a comprehensive initiative in the early 1990s by the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the World Bank and the Harvard School of Public Health. Since then, it has evolved into an ongoing and collaborative effort involving researchers from around the world. It aims to quantify and analyze the health loss caused by diseases, injuries and risk factors in population worldwide. It provides a systematic and rigourous assessment of the global burden of diseases and their impact on health.\n\nThe causes of death dataset can help us gain valuable insights into global moratlity patterns. It helps us identify the leading causes of moratlity, as well as their distribution across different regions. By knowing the specific causes of death, policymakers and public health professionals can identify priority areas for intervention and allocate resources effectively. The dataset enables cross-country comparisons, highlighting variations in causes of death. \n\nThis information is valuable for understanding disparities in health outcomes, identifying successful interventions in specific regions, and promoting best practices globally. It can serve as a powerful advocacy tool to mobilize resources, generate public support, and drive political action towards addressing these health issues.\n\n## Part 3. Dataset Introduction\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease is a major global study on the causes of death and disease published in the medical journal The Lancet. The dataset represents data for all demographic people from the year 1990 to 2019 as mentioned on their website. We extract our data from this source.\n\nThe dataset includes data on country level. Every row in the dataset mentions the annual death numbers attributed to each of the cause for the specified country during the mentioned year.\n\n## Part 4. Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset contains data for all countries(globally) across time period 1990 to 2019. It has 200772 rows and 6 columns, i.e., it covers a wide range of causes of death for various countries from the year 1990 to 2019. \n\nThe 6 columns in the dataset represent the following:\n\nCauses name - This represents the cause of death. This can be a disease or a natural phenomena or a legal action\n\nCauses Full Description - This represents if the death is in all age groups or in a particular set of age groups, and weather it is in all the genders or in specific gender. In the dataset that we are using, we can see that all the data is mentioned for all ages and genders. \n\nDeath Numbers - This represents the annual number of deaths for specific value of cause, year and country\n\nEntity - This represents the name of the country in which the deaths occurred.\n\nCode - This represents the ISO Code of the country in which deaths occurred\n\nYear - This represents the year in which the deaths occurred.\n\nCoding Component:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\ndeath_dataset <- read_csv(\"NehaJhurani_FinalProjectData/CausesOfDeath.csv\")\n#Dimensions of Global Death Dataset\ndim(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 200772      6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Columns of death dataset\ncolnames(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Causes name\"             \"Causes Full Description\"\n[3] \"Death Numbers\"           \"Entity\"                 \n[5] \"Code\"                    \"Year\"                   \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Viewing first few rows of the dataset\nhead(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"Causes name\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Causes Full Description\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Death Numbers\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"Entity\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Code\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Year\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Meningitis\",\"2\":\"Deaths - Meningitis - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)\",\"3\":\"2933\",\"4\":\"Afghanistan\",\"5\":\"AFG\",\"6\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Neoplasms\",\"2\":\"Deaths - Neoplasms - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)\",\"3\":\"15925\",\"4\":\"Afghanistan\",\"5\":\"AFG\",\"6\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Fire, heat, and hot substances\",\"2\":\"Deaths - Fire, heat, and hot substances - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)\",\"3\":\"481\",\"4\":\"Afghanistan\",\"5\":\"AFG\",\"6\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Malaria\",\"2\":\"Deaths - Malaria - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)\",\"3\":\"393\",\"4\":\"Afghanistan\",\"5\":\"AFG\",\"6\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Drowning\",\"2\":\"Deaths - Drowning - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)\",\"3\":\"2127\",\"4\":\"Afghanistan\",\"5\":\"AFG\",\"6\":\"2007\"},{\"1\":\"Interpersonal violence\",\"2\":\"Deaths - Interpersonal violence - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)\",\"3\":\"3657\",\"4\":\"Afghanistan\",\"5\":\"AFG\",\"6\":\"2007\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summary of each of the columns in the dataset\nsummary(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n Causes name        Causes Full Description Death Numbers    \n Length:200772      Length:200772           Min.   :      0  \n Class :character   Class :character        1st Qu.:     14  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character        Median :    209  \n                                            Mean   :   7712  \n                                            3rd Qu.:   1860  \n                                            Max.   :4584273  \n                                            NA's   :11127    \n    Entity              Code                Year     \n Length:200772      Length:200772      Min.   :1990  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:1997  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :2004  \n                                       Mean   :2004  \n                                       3rd Qu.:2012  \n                                       Max.   :2019  \n                                                     \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe mean number of annual deaths across countires during the years 1990 to 2019 is around 7712.

We can see above that the highest number of deaths during those years are due to cardiovascular diseases. \n\nData Preprocessing:\na) We have already renamed few columns of our data for better understanding.\nb) Many ISO Codes are missing. As this is same as Country Name that is represented by Entity (which is non null), we will drop Code column.\nc) Dropping 'Causes Full Description' because that column mentions that the data is for all age groups and genders. As all of the data are for the same demographic people, having this column is redundant or unnecessary.\nd) We saw above that Number of deaths are missing in a lot of rows. GBD study provides detailed information about the data sources used, the methodology employed and any known data gaps or limitations. After going through their official website, the following are the possible reasons why we see missing or NA values for number of deaths in GBD study - \n- limitations in data collection processes. This can happen in countries with limited healtcare infrastructure which could lead to incomplete death reporting, lack of standardized tests, etc. \n- Vital registration systems, which records births, death, and causes of death, may be less developed or incomplete in some countries. So, lack of reporting system can lead to missing values.\n- The source of data is of inadequate quality or is unreliable.\n- Access to mortality data may be restricted due to legal or privacy considerations, especially in cases where individual-level data is involved. This can result in missing values for specific years or regions.\n- as the study is dynamic and ever evolving, delay in reporting can also lead to NA or missing values.\nFor our analysis we will drop those rows. This is because we are more concerned about analyzing the established causes of death rather than analysing the gaps in the data collection. Also, Dropping the rows is more appropriate than making them 0 because 'there are no deaths for that particular cause' or 'that particular cause of death is non existent' describes the same case. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndeath_dataset <- death_dataset %>%  \n    select(-c(`Causes Full Description`, `Code`)) %>% \n    as.data.frame()\nhead(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"\"],\"name\":[\"_rn_\"],\"type\":[\"\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Cause\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"NumberOfDeaths\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"Country\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Year\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Meningitis\",\"2\":\"2933\",\"3\":\"Afghanistan\",\"4\":\"2007\",\"_rn_\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"Neoplasms\",\"2\":\"15925\",\"3\":\"Afghanistan\",\"4\":\"2007\",\"_rn_\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"Fire, heat, and hot substances\",\"2\":\"481\",\"3\":\"Afghanistan\",\"4\":\"2007\",\"_rn_\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"Malaria\",\"2\":\"393\",\"3\":\"Afghanistan\",\"4\":\"2007\",\"_rn_\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"Drowning\",\"2\":\"2127\",\"3\":\"Afghanistan\",\"4\":\"2007\",\"_rn_\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"Interpersonal violence\",\"2\":\"3657\",\"3\":\"Afghanistan\",\"4\":\"2007\",\"_rn_\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndeath_dataset <- death_dataset%>%drop_na('NumberOfDeaths')\n\n#Checking if all NA values rows are dropped\nsum(is.na(death_dataset$NumberOfDeaths))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Part 5. Analyses Plan\nWe will analyze the above dataset to answer the following granular questions :\n\n- Which group of diseases contribute highest to death numbers over the years?\n\n- What are the total number of deaths every year from 1990 to 2019?\n\n- Which countries have the highest number of deaths every year?\n\n- Which countries have the lowest number of deaths every year?\n\n- What is the most common cause of death across the world for the time period 1990-2019?\n\n- What is the trend of the 3 of the most common cause of death over the years?\n\n- How is the number of deaths related to mental illness over the years in the extracted dataset?\n\n- In which year were the highest number of deaths across the world?\n\nVisual representations, such as graphs, charts, and diagrams, can simplify complex concepts, patterns, or relationships, making them easier to understand and comprehend. They help us identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in data more easily. We will be using the following types of graph for our project:\n\nBivariate and Multivariate Graphs : They allow us to identify the nature of the relationship between two or more variables. We can determine if the variables are positively or negatively correlated, or if there is no apparent relationship between them. We will be using these graphs to find the relations between the time-period and the number of deaths across countries and diseases.\n\nHistogram/Bar Graphs : Histograms or Bar graphs provide a visual representation of the distribution of data, allowing us to observe the shape, center, and spread of the variable. We will be using these to represent the most common diseases across countries and the number of deaths globally for every year from 1990 to 2019.\n\n## Part 6.

that is, there has been a decrease in infectious diseases and increase in chronic diseases. As societies develop and living conditions improve, people experience demographic and lifestyle changes that contributes to a higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These changes include aging populations, urbanization, unhealthy diets, tobacco and alchol use, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, there have been global efforts such as vaccination programs, improved sanitation, and access to healthcare which have helped to prevent and treat infectious diseases effectively. As a result, the proportion of deaths due to communicable diseases has decreased in many countries.\n\nWe can also see that the number of deaths due to injuries have decreased in the recent years. This is due to several factors - many countries have implemented measures to enhance road safety, including stricter traffic regulations, improved infrastructure, and public awareness campaigns. There has also been advancement in emergency medical services and trauma. Faster response times, better pre-hospital care and specialized trauma centers have increased the chances of survival for individuals with severe injuries. Many safety regulations have been enforced for workplace safety.Public health interventions, such as improved access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene practices, have helped reduce the incidence of injuries caused by environmental factors.\n\nRepresenting the above data in a more tidy format by creating a key-value pair across multiple column values:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

These regions have relatively younger populations with lower motality rates compared to countries with older populations.\n\nFor further analyses, lets consider the following countries - China, India, United States, Tuvalu, Hong Kong.\nWe are selecting these countries so that we can analyze the trends for the countries with different death rates. China, India and United States represent the ones that have higher annual deaths and Hong Kong and Tuvalu represent the ones that have lesser annual deaths for the years 1990 to 2019.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndeath_data_subset <- death_dataset[death_dataset$Country== (alist('United States', 'India', 'China', 'Nigeria', 'Tuvalu')),]\n\n# Dimensions of the subset\ndim(death_data_subset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 954   4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summary of the subset dataset\nsummary(death_data_subset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Cause           NumberOfDeaths      Country               Year     \n Length:954         Min.   :      0   Length:954         Min.   :1990  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:    200   Class :character   1st Qu.:1997  \n Mode  :character   Median :  11740   Mode  :character   Median :2005  \n                    Mean   : 123813                      Mean   :2005  \n                    3rd Qu.:  75378                      3rd Qu.:2012  \n                    Max.   :4459245                      Max.   :2019  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLeading causes of deaths worldwide for the years 1990 to 2019 :\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(frequency_of_causes %>% arrange(desc(deaths)), n=10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"Cause\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"fct\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"deaths\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Cardiovascular diseases\",\"2\":\"447185738\"},{\"1\":\"Neoplasms\",\"2\":\"229503682\"},{\"1\":\"Chronic respiratory diseases\",\"2\":\"104502658\"},{\"1\":\"Lower respiratory infections\",\"2\":\"83146095\"},{\"1\":\"Neonatal disorders\",\"2\":\"76099923\"},{\"1\":\"Diarrheal diseases\",\"2\":\"65867214\"},{\"1\":\"Digestive diseases\",\"2\":\"65461101\"},{\"1\":\"Tuberculosis\",\"2\":\"45606215\"},{\"1\":\"Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases\",\"2\":\"37372823\"},{\"1\":\"Road injuries\",\"2\":\"36203659\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see that the top 3 causes of death worldwide for the years 1990 to 2019 are Cardiovascular diseases, Neoplasms and Chronic respiratory diseases\n\nTo further analyze, I am extracting the trends of each of the top causes of death for the years for the subset we created.\n\nRepresenting Number of Deaths in the extracted dataset at the country level over the years:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndeath_data_subset %>%\n  group_by(Country, Year)%>%\n  summarise(deaths = sum(NumberOfDeaths))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = deaths, col = Country)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 1) + \n  geom_smooth(se = F, span = 0.2) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2019, 3), minor_breaks = T) + \n  labs(title = \"Number of Deaths in the extracted dataset\", \n       subtitle = \"1990 - 2019\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Deaths\", \n       col = \"Country\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NehaJhurani_FinalProjectDraft_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see that the highest number of deaths are in China.

The risk factors have changed over time, such as obesity rates, unhealthy dietary patterns, sedentary lifestyles, etc because of which we are seeing the above trend.\nThe increase in deaths can be because of changes in lifestyle, economic development, rapid urbanization, etc. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nneo_dataset <- death_data_subset[death_data_subset$'Cause'=='Neoplasms',]\n\nneo_dataset%>%\n  group_by(Country, Year, NumberOfDeaths)%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = NumberOfDeaths, col = Country)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(se = F, span = 1.5) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2019, 3), minor_breaks = T) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 5000000, 200000), minor_breaks = T) + \n  labs(title = \"Number of Deaths due to Neoplasms in the extracted subset\",\n       subtitle = \"1990 - 2019\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Deaths\", \n       col = \"Country\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NehaJhurani_FinalProjectDraft_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe see that the number of deaths due to Neoplasms has increased steeply in India, China, United States and has increased in Nigeria whereas there is hardly any change in Tuvalu.\nThe increase in death numbers may be because of lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol comsumption, tobacco use, etc. In smaller countries, more importance is given to public health safety and enough measures are enforced to make sure of it and therefore there is very less change in them.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchronic_dataset <- death_data_subset[death_data_subset$'Cause'=='Chronic respiratory diseases',]\n\nchronic_dataset%>%\n  group_by(Country, Year, NumberOfDeaths)%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = NumberOfDeaths, col = Country)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(se = F, span = 1.5) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2019, 3), minor_breaks = T) + \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 5000000, 200000), minor_breaks = T) + \n  labs(title = \"Number of Deaths due to Chronic respiratory diseases in extracted subset\",\n       subtitle = \"1990 - 2019\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Deaths\", \n       col = \"Country\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NehaJhurani_FinalProjectDraft_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe see that the number of deaths increases significantly in case of India and United States but there is hardly any change in case of Nigeria and Tuvalu. The increase is because air pollution, especially in urban areas and indoor air pollution from the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating. \nWe also see a decrease in the number of deaths due to Chronic respiratory diseases in China. This is because it has implemented various measures to address air pollution which is a significant contributor to chronic respiratory diseases. These measures include stricter regulations on industrial emissions, promotion of clean energy sources, and implementation of pollution control policies. Improved air quality reduces exposure to harmful pollutants and subsequently decreases the risk of respiratory diseases.\n\n\nMental illness significantly affects individual well-being, quality of life, and overall functioning. It can lead to emotional distress, impaired cognitive functioning, and difficulties in maintaining relationships, work, and daily activities. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide and contributes to a substantial burden of disease. By addressing mental health issues, societies can reduce the overall burden of disease and promote healthier communities.\nIt has a significant impact on public health. A lot of causes related to mental illness have been specified in the dataset. We are considering \"Drug use disorders\", \"Alcohol use disorders\" and \"Self-harm\" to analyze the number of deaths due to mental health in the extracted dataset:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmi_dataset <- death_data_subset[death_data_subset$'Cause'== (alist(\"Alcohol use disorders\",\"Drug use disorders\",\"Self-harm\")),]\n\nmi_dataset%>%\n  group_by(Cause, Year, Country)%>%\n  summarise(deaths = sum(NumberOfDeaths)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = deaths, col = Country)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(se = F, span = 1.5) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2019, 3), minor_breaks = T) + \n  labs(title = \"Number of Deaths due to Mental Illness in extracted subset\",\n       subtitle = \"1990 - 2019\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Deaths\", \n       col = \"Cause\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NehaJhurani_FinalProjectDraft_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe see a increase and the decrease in number of deaths in India due to mental illness. This is because of the mental health policies and legislations which focuses on promoting mental well-being.The same reason applies to Nigeria as well. Over time, there has been a growing awareness and recognition of mental health in both India and Nigeria.\nDue to proper healthcare infrastructure and less population, we hardly see any change in Tuvalu.\nWe see a decrease and then steep increase in the number of deaths due to mental illness in China and we can also see an exponential increase in US. This is because of inadequate access to mental health services, including insufficient availability of mental health professionals, limited insurance coverage for mental treatment, etc. Increases in substance abuse or any other drug-related problems, can exacerbate mental health issues increasing the risk of mortality.\n\nNumber of Deaths per year \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Extracting the year with the highest number of deaths for every country\ndeath_numbers_by_country_year <- death_dataset %>%\n  group_by(Country, Year)%>%\n  summarise(deaths = sum(NumberOfDeaths)) %>%\n  top_n(1, deaths)\n\n#Representing the above result using histogram\nggplot(death_numbers_by_country_year, aes(x = Year)) + geom_histogram(color=\"black\", fill=\"pink\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NehaJhurani_FinalProjectDraft_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see from the graph that majority of countries have the highest number of deaths in the year of 2019.\n\n## Part 7. Conclusion and Discussion\nAfter analyzing this dataset, we were able to see that Non-communicable diseases caused the majority of deaths across the world during the years 1990 to 2019. The number of deaths have increased from 1990 to 2019 globally. Countries with denser population had higher number of deaths whereas countries with lesser population and better healthcare infrastructure had fewer number of deaths. The leading cause of death is Cardiovascular diseases throughout the world during the years 1990 to 2019. Deaths caused due to mental illness have also increased over the years.\nThis dataset can be used to do an in-depth analyses on the causes of death, like relating obesity rate with cardiovascular disease, etc. This dataset in corelation with other variables (subset of age groups and genders) can be utilized to investigate the underlying causes of mortality. This will improve our understanding of public health challenges and help control or prevent the number of deaths throughout the world. This will definitely aid in future research directions.\n\n## Part 8.
