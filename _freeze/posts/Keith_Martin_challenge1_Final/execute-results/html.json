This data set contains the information about the type, country of origin, and amount of poultry that was produced around the world. This data is relatively straight forward based on the data values. I have included the first few rows below for reference.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect(birds, \"Area\", \"Item\", \"Year\", \"Value\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 30,977 × 4\n   Area        Item      Year Value\n   <chr>       <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 Afghanistan Chickens  1961  4700\n 2 Afghanistan Chickens  1962  4900\n 3 Afghanistan Chickens  1963  5000\n 4 Afghanistan Chickens  1964  5300\n 5 Afghanistan Chickens  1965  5500\n 6 Afghanistan Chickens  1966  5800\n 7 Afghanistan Chickens  1967  6600\n 8 Afghanistan Chickens  1968  6290\n 9 Afghanistan Chickens  1969  6300\n10 Afghanistan Chickens  1970  6000\n# … with 30,967 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Visualization Analysis:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBird <- select(birds, \"Item\")\ntable(Bird)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nItem\n              Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls \n                 13074                   6909                   4136 \n  Pigeons, other birds                Turkeys \n                  1165                   5693 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.table(table(Bird))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nItem\n              Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls \n            0.42205507             0.22303645             0.13351842 \n  Pigeons, other birds                Turkeys \n            0.03760855             0.18378152 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI have included tables describing the type of poultry and their respective county. Additionally, I have included the proportions of each type of bird throughout the entirety of the data. As you can see from above, Chicken makes up about 42% of the poultry production, Ducks make up about 22%, Turkeys make up about 18%, Geese and Guinea fowls make up about 13% and Pigeons and other beards make up about 3.7%.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### This section of code specifies the values on the below charts. \nggplot(data = birds, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Item)) +\n          geom_line() +\n        facet_wrap(vars(Item)) +\n### Titles of the below charts including a title for each axis\n  labs(title = \"Poultry Production from 1960-2018\",\n                                     x = \"Year\",\n                                     y = \"Amount of Poultry\") +\n### This section of code represents the texts formation of the below charts (Thanks, Megan!!)\n          theme_bw() +\n          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 6, angle = 90, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5),\n                                    axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 6),\n                                        strip.text = element_text(face = \"italic\"),\n                                       text = element_text(size = 10))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Keith_Martin_challenge1_Final_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above code was borrowed from a similar analysis (Megan Galarneau).

I attempted to use graphs, but I was unable to find an attractive way to include all the information without going through and combining the countries via region. My geography is a somewhat rusty.\n\nI have included above the proportions of the productions from each country listed in the data set. I have separated the two tables to avoid any confusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have come to the conclusion that this is a data set that is describing the poultry production of every country. It is separated via country, production, year and type of poultry produced.\n",
