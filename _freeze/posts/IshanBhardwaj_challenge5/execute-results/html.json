The data seems to be relatively recent because the latest date of last review for an Airbnb was in the middle of 2019.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nThis data is already tidy because each relevant variable has its own column, each case its own row, and each value its own cell.\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\nFor my analysis, all the required variables have the right data type and format, so there is no need for recoding or mutation.\n\n## Univariate Visualizations\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ab_nyc, aes(neighbourhood_group)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Airbnb count by neighborhood groups\", x = \"Area\", y = \"Airbnb residence count\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IshanBhardwaj_challenge5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis graph tells us which neighborhood groups in New York have the highest number of Airbnb residences. As seen, Manhattan and Brooklyn far outweigh the other locations with respect to this variable. This is useful as it can hint us to which areas of New York are more tourist-centric. I chose a bar graph here because I am measuring one categorical variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ab_nyc, aes(minimum_nights)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 500, by = 100)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Airbnb minimum nights counts\", x = \"Minimum no. of nights\", y = \"Airbnb residence count\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IshanBhardwaj_challenge5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis graph tells us that most of the observations in this dataset are for relatively short-term stays, with an overwhelming majority of residences requiring a minimum stay of 0-25 nights, followed by 25-50 nights. This confirms that this data is targeted towards tourists/visitors. I chose a histogram plot here because I am measuring one continuous variable.\n\n## Bivariate Visualization(s)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ab_nyc, aes(room_type, price)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Room type vs price\", x = \"Room type\", y = \"Price\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IshanBhardwaj_challenge5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis plot tells us that while all the room types share a similar median, the variance in price range for entire homes/apartments is much more than that of private rooms and shared rooms. Most of the data points across all room types seem to fit under the 5000 price barrier, but for entire homes, there exists a non-negligible number of instances nearing the upper end of this barrier and going across it as well. Shared rooms have a relatively small price range, not going above the 2500 price barrier. This can give insights into what types of rooms are more common in New York and where the common price ranges for each category lie. I chose a box plot here because I am comparing a categorical and continuous variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ab_nyc, aes(neighbourhood_group, number_of_reviews)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Area vs No. of reviews\", x = \"Area\", y = \"No. of reviews\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](IshanBhardwaj_challenge5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis plot tells us the trend of leaving reviews for each area, which indirectly tells us which areas had the most number of visits, as one review corresponds to a single stay at a residence. From here, we can see that Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens are all popular spots for stay as their range of review counts has the most population and variation. Their box plots are quite populated till the 400 reviews barrier, which is a considerably higher ceiling than that of The Bronx or Staten Island. I chose a box plot here because I am comparing a categorical and continuous variable.\n",
