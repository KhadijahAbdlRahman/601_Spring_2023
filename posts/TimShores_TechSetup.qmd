## My content

This evening, I followed Erico's excellent to-do list to get my initial setup tasks complete. Last night, after our first class, I took a little time to update RStudio and connect it to my GitHub account. 

I had to do a little housekeeping: first, I removed a space from the directory where I'm saving my 601 R projects, since Erico's document advised against spaces. I also spent some time wondering and worrying about the Windows 11 warning. I'm running Windows 11, and I don't have a simple way to downgrade to Windows 10. I don't seem to have any problem rendering .qmd files. So, I'm not going to worry about it for now.
