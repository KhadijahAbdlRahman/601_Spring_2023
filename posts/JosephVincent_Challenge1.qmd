## Reading in the data

railroad <- read_csv("_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv")
head(railroad)

```

## Describing the dataset

This data set consists of 3 columns: State, County and Total Employees. It appears that the data set is showing the number of railroad employees by county in the United States. 

The least number of railroad employees in a given county is 1, and the greatest number of railroad employees in a given county is over 8,000. 

There is a mean number of employees per county of about 87, but with a large standard deviation (283).

I learned that there are 31 counties with the name "Washington" and 26 counties with the name "Jefferson".

## Data summary
