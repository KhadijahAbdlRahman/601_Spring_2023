## Looking at the data

These data were likely gathered from a survey of occupations across geographies conducted by a federal agency such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Each case is a county in the United States with at least one railroad worker. (The state and county columns are both essential for defining a case, since some county names occur in more than one state, and the state column is necessary for disambiguation.) The total_employees column indicates the number of railroad employees in the relevant county.
