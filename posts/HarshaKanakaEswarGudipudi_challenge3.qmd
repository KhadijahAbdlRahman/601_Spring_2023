## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organiceggpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.xlsx 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}

library(readr)
#Read eggs_tidy csv data
df <- read_csv("_data/eggs_tidy.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)
head(df)
```

### Briefly describe the data

The summary below is showing the data for the month, year, and prices of different types of egg cartons over a period of 10 years from 2004 to 2013. The data is summarized based on the different egg carton sizes, which include large_half_dozen, large_dozen, extra_large_half_dozen, and extra_large_dozen.The data shows that the average price for the large_half_dozen egg cartons is \$155.2, while the average price for the large_dozen egg cartons is \$254.2. The average price for extra_large_half_dozen egg cartons is \$164.2, and the average price for extra_large_dozen egg cartons is \$266.8.

```{r}
#| label: summary
summary(df)
dim(df)
cat(paste("no of rows in df = ", nrow(df)))
```

## Anticipate the End Result
Here the four columns "large_half_dozen, large_dozen, extra_large_half_dozen, extra_large_dozen" which can be made into two columns based on the size and quantity. And the corresponding values for the eggs should be displayed in the new column as price.


### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions


Here we are piovting 4 columns and the no of rows of df is 120 before pivoting. So the final no of rows would be equal to nrows(df)*4 = 120*4 = 480 and the no of columns after pivoting = 3+2 = 5. therefore the final dimension is 480*5.

## Pivot the Data

Now we will pivot the data, and compare our pivoted data dimensions to the dimensions calculated above as a "sanity" check.

### Example

```{r}
df_long <- df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(month, year),
    names_to = c("size", "quantity"),
    names_pattern = "(.+)_(.+)",
    values_to = "price"
  )

# View the pivoted data frame
df_long
print("size: ")
print(dim(df_long))
```

Yes, once it is pivoted long, our resulting data are $480x5$ - exactly what we expected!

### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data

Document your work here. What will a new "case" be once you have pivoted the data? How does it meet requirements for tidy data?

Once pivoted, each row in the new data frame represents a unique combination of month, year, size, quantity and price. The value column contains the corresponding value for each combination. This meets the requirements for tidy data because each row represents a single observation and each variable is in a separate column. Additionally, the column names are informative and easy to understand.

```{r}


```

Any additional comments?
