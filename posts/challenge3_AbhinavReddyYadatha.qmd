## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organiceggpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.xlsx 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}

library(readr)
#Read eggs_tidy csv data
egg_tidy_data <- read_csv("_data/eggs_tidy.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)

egg_tidy_data = egg_tidy_data[-1,]
head(egg_tidy_data)
view(egg_tidy_data)

dim(egg_tidy_data)

# Summary of the eggs dataset
summary(egg_tidy_data)

```

### Briefly describe the data

The dataset encompasses ten years of monthly data, specifically from January 2004 to December 2013, and tracks the mean volume of six distinct types of egg cartons. Although the dataset contains decimal values, which indicate the values are averages, it's worth noting that cartons of eggs are sold in whole units. For instance, in February 2004, the dataset records a value of 128.5 for the volume of large half dozen sized cartons.

## Anticipate the End Result

The end result would display the sizes "large" and "xlarge" in the "size" column, while the "quantity" column should include "halfdozen" and "dozen." Finally, the corresponding values for each combination of size and quantity should be listed in a new column titled "price."


### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions

rows = 120*4 (as 4 columns pivoted) == 480
columns = 5 (4 columns made into 3 -> size quantity and price)

The final dimensions of the dataset would be 480 x 5.

## Pivot the Data

Now we will pivot the data, and compare our pivoted data dimensions to the dimensions calculated above as a "sanity" check.

### Example

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Pivoted Example

#df<-pivot_longer(df, col = c(outgoing, incoming),
#                 names_to="trade_direction",
#                 values_to = "trade_value")
#df

egg_pivot_data<-pivot_longer(egg_tidy_data, cols = contains("dozen"),
                              names_to= c("size", "quantity"),
                              names_sep = "_",
                              values_to = "price")
head(egg_pivot_data)

```

Yes, once it is pivoted long, our resulting data are $480x5$ - exactly what we expected!

### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data

Document your work here. What will a new "case" be once you have pivoted the data? How does it meet requirements for tidy data?

```{r}


```

Any additional comments?

The new case would be highly readible and user-friendly. Additionally, it's possible to incorporate additional data points, such as "medium" for size and "halfdozen" for quantity, to the existing dataset without requiring the addition of any new columns.
