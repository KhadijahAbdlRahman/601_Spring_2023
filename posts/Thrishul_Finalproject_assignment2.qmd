# Introduction

This data science project aims to explore and analyze a comprehensive dataset of job titles, salaries, employment types, company sizes and locations within the field of data science. With a focus on understanding current trends and patterns, this project seeks to provide insights into the current state of the data science job market. Through analyzing the distribution of job titles, seniority levels, salaries, and employment types, we can gain an understanding of the most common roles, skillsets, and experience required in the field. Additionally, examining the location and size of companies can provide insights into which regions are leading in the data science industry and what size of companies are more likely to hire data scientists. This project aims to provide valuable insights to job seekers, employers, and researchers in the data science field.

## Dataset Description
