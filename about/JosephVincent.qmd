## Education/Work Background
I graduated in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in Marketing and Health & Life Sciences from Boston University.
Since then, I have been working for a digital healthcare start-up doing business development for the US.

## R experience
I have a little bit of R experience from a machine learning class I took at BU, but I don't remember much of it.

## Research interests
I am interested in digital healthcare and public health for my work, but also have an unrelated interest in public transit/urban planning.

## Hometown
I grew up in rural New York State, but have lived in and around Boston for the past 6 years.

## Hobbies
I like hiking in the Fells Reservation with my dog during the weekends. I play the drums and guitar. Also crosswords, Sudoku puzzles.

## Fun fact
I spent a summer as a gravedigger.
