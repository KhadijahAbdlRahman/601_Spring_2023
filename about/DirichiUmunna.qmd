## Education/Work Background

I am a PH.D student at the department of sociology. I am currently in the first year of my training.

## R experience

I have zero R experience and hope to leave this class with some R knowledge on how to use R for data science purposes.

## Research interests

My research interests broadly intersect feminism in African and Diasporic circles as well as Pan-Africanism.

## Hometown

I am from Nigeria and my tribe is the Igbo tribe of Eastern Nigeria.

## Hobbies

I love to watch sitcoms, play music and generally spend time with people I care about.

## Fun fact

I am the only daughter of my parents as I grew up with 5 brothers.
