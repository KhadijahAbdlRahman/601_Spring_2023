## Education/Work Background
My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and Finance (double major). Professionally, I worked in accounting and financial analysis roles, doing auditing, accounting, reporting, budgeting, forecasting, contract modeling and ad hoc analysis for organizational decison-makers. In some of these roles, I dabbled in obtaining data from the various informaton systems to then use in modelling for analysis.

I pivoted to Higher Education Leadership and Student Affairs, completing a Masters in Educational Leadership policy for postsecondary education (ie: higher education/college/university). I am a passionate advocate of underrepresented students, including first generation students, and low-income students.

The importance of communicating the meaning of what lies within data and its analysis drives my work in R.

## R experience
I think I'm up to 12 days of experience as of this posting : ) 

## Research interests
Broadly speaking, Higher Education topics (including Financial Aid & Student Access) and Social Justice Topics

## Hometown
Dedham, Iowa - the 'other' Dedham...named after...you guessed it! Dedham, MA. I've lived a few places since then, and now I live near the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.


## Hobbies
Thrifting, antiques, New England history, hiking, music of many genres, museums (art, history, cultural), travel (whenever COVID risk allows), finding good local breweries and cooking/baking.

## Fun fact
My last name is of Slovenian origin (Slovenia is near Austria and formerly a part of Yugoslavia). It is pronounced smO-lee.
