## Education/Work Background
I graduated with my Bachelors in Marketing w/Communications in December 2021. I’m currently working in Marketing Operations for a tech start-up in Boston, MA.

## R experience
I have no R experience, but I come from (and am getting married to) a family of programmers. Safe to stay, my journey to learning to code was inevitable.

## Research interests
Still learning what my interests are, but excited to learn. In my undergrad I researched the impact of mindfulness practices on employee performance. I enjoyed it quite a bit and would like to return to it one day with fresh eyes and an advanced skill set.

## Hometown
Dover, NH

## Hobbies
Most recently, learning to play piano. It’s going slow but steady.

## Fun fact
My fiance and I adopted a long-hair orange tabby named Morph. Treasure Planet inspired name for those who catch the reference..
