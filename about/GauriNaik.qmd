I have zero experience in R!

## Research interests
I am interested in clinical anthropology, especially using quantitative and qualitative variables to describe correlations in demographics and medical phenomena.

## Hometown
Dunstable, MA, which is a small right-to-farm community; my family has 6 chickens!

## Hobbies
I love to knit, read, drink tea, and dance. 

## Fun fact
My favorite fruit is jackfruit!
