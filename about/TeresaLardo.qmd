## Education/Work Background

I spent the last 8 years working for an educational software and services company. My bachelor's degree is in English, with a concentration in creative writing.

## R experience

I have almost no experience in R, but studied some R basics for a few weeks before entering the DACSS program.

## Hometown

I'm currently living in Medford, Mass., with a partner, our two roommates, and a cat who is, of course, the most important member of the household.

## Hobbies

I enjoy writing poetry, making beaded jewelry, and painting watercolor birds. I love learning and also take non-university classes for fun when I can; as I begin the DACSS program, I am finishing up a year-long course on tropical astrology as well as a short Atlas Obscura course on fairy tale writing.

## Fun fact

Your mileage may vary on how fun this fact is, but I only started drinking coffee because of a series of murder mystery novels set in the Scottish Highlands. The detective in the series is constantly visiting townsfolk and being served tea or coffee, and I envied the cozy vibe while I listened to the audiobooks at work, so I started paying visits to the office coffee machine.
